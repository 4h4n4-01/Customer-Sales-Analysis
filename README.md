# E-Commerce Customer Intelligence & Sales Forecasting

This project analyses customer behaviour, purchasing patterns, and segmentation data to understand revenue drivers in an e-commerce environment and develop machine learning models for sales forecasting.

By integrating behavioural analytics, unsupervised customer segmentation, and time-series predictive modelling, the project demonstrates how data-driven insights can support targeted marketing strategies, improve customer retention, and optimise revenue growth.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Analyse customer purchasing behaviour and engagement patterns  
- Segment customers into meaningful behavioural personas using clustering  
- Identify key factors influencing sales performance  
- Quantify revenue contribution by customer segment  
- Build predictive models to forecast future sales trends  

## 📊 Key Components

### 1. Customer Behaviour Analysis  
Exploration of purchase frequency, basket size, spending trends, and engagement metrics to understand how customers interact with the platform.

### 2. Customer Segmentation  
Application of unsupervised machine learning (K-Means clustering) to identify distinct customer groups such as loyal shoppers, high-value occasional buyers, newly engaged customers, and disengaged high-income segments.

### 3. Sales Performance Analysis  
Time-series analysis of daily transactions, revenue trends, seasonality, and promotional effects.

### 4. Revenue Contribution & Insights  
Linking customer segments to total revenue to highlight high-impact groups and growth opportunities.

### 5. Sales Forecasting  
Feature engineering with lag variables, rolling statistics, and seasonality encoding followed by predictive modelling using Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
